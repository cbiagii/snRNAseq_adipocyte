Hi folks, my name is Carlos and I'm R, bioinformatics and single-cell enthusiast! Since 2012, I have been working with microarray and RNA-seq data, but things started to get more intense when, in 2017, I started my PhD at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/) in Department of Genetics in [Ribeirão Preto Medical School](https://www.fmrp.usp.br/en/). Since then I have been dedicating myself to single-cell analysis.

I'm currently as PhD Researcher Assistant at the [Universität zu Köln](https://www.uni-koeln.de/) working in [Prof. Martin Peifer](http://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/people/core-scientists/prof-dr-martin-peifer) lab in the [Department of Translational Genomics](https://www.translational-genomics.uni-koeln.de/).

I have always kept in mind that good science is science that can be reproduced and shared. Based on this principle, I decided to create this blog to share good and bad experiences that I had and I am having during this journey as a bioinformatician. The main idea is to share solutions I found for the problems I had. I sincerely hope that this blog can help other people and also that it is a means of new connections with people in the bioinformatics field.

May the force be with you!
